Language: JAVA

Server : Both Encoding --- binary value to voltage levels
Parity : Manually added in the last bit
Data : input in console --- segmented in to 8 bit chunks + 1 bit for parity

Client : Both Decoding --- Voltage levels to binary data
Parity : Checked and compared with the last bit of encoded and decoded data
Data : output shows both input voltage levels from server and decoded signal.


#as there is no error should happen for this experiment. Parity check is just for nothing here# 

:)
Wanna contribute or experiment with code,,,let me know...
